# Threats to validity

Each threat, and the specific countermeasure this repository implements. A
comparison that ignores any of these produces numbers that look precise and mean
nothing.

## T1 -- Non-determinism

The same model on the same task does not always produce the same outcome.

**Countermeasure.** Randomise *tasks*, not repetitions. A paired design over
200 tasks with one run each carries far more information than 20 tasks run 10
times, because task difficulty dominates run-to-run variance. Analysis is paired
per task (McNemar), never pooled.

**Residual risk.** A single run per task cannot separate "the harness failed"
from "the model had a bad draw". Report per-task outcomes so this is visible,
and repeat only the discordant pairs if a tie-break is needed.

## T2 -- Temporal drift

Provider latency moves, models are silently updated, rate limits change.

**Countermeasure.** Interleave arms: A, B, A, B -- never A, A, ..., B, B.
Blocked ordering converts any drift over the run into a difference between arms.
Record wall-clock timestamps for every trial and check for a trend before
trusting a result.

## T3 -- Contamination

Public benchmarks are plausibly in pretraining data.

**Countermeasure.** Keep a held-out private task set whose solutions are never
published, and report it separately. Run a canary: strip the solution from a
public task and check whether the agent behaves as if it remembers the tests.
Terminal-Bench is newer and less likely to be contaminated than SWE-bench, but
"less likely" is not "verified".

## T4 -- Budget caps as a confound

If one harness hits a token or turn cap and another does not, the cap is
measuring, not the harness.

**Countermeasure.** Set generous caps, equal across arms, and report the
distribution of actual consumption alongside the censored count. A result driven
by an arm hitting the ceiling must be reported as `budget_exhausted`, not as a
loss.

## T5 -- Winning by spending

A harness can buy pass rate with tokens.

**Countermeasure.** Pass rate is never reported alone. Report
`tokens_per_solved_task` and `cost_per_solved_task`, and plot the
cost/pass-rate frontier. Dominance, not raw score, is the interesting relation:
a harness that is cheaper *and* passes more is unambiguously better; one that
passes 3 points more for 4x the cost has not obviously won.

## T6 -- Asymmetric observability

XHarness reports five token dimensions (uncached input, output, cache read,
cache write, reasoning). Other harnesses report fewer, or define them
differently -- some include reasoning in output, some count cache reads as
input.

**Countermeasure.** The primary metric is externally verified pass/fail, which
no harness self-reports. Token data is recorded for everything and compared only
within Tier A, where both arms run the same accounting code.

## T7 -- Test tampering

An agent can pass by editing the tests.

**Countermeasure.** Verify on a pristine checkout: apply only the agent's diff to
a clean tree, restore all test files from the reference, then run. Record the
hash of test files before and after; a change means the trial is
`verifier_rejected`, not a pass. This is a correctness requirement, not a
nicety -- without it the metric is trivially gameable.

## T8 -- Misattribution

A pass rate cannot distinguish "this harness is good" from "this model is good"
or "the task was easy".

**Countermeasure.** The oracle / nop / mini-swe-agent triad described in the
README. Oracle bounds the task set from above, nop from below, and mini-swe-agent
establishes what a trivial scaffold achieves. A harness that does not clear
mini-swe-agent has not earned its complexity.

## T9 -- Adapter bugs masquerading as harness quality

The adapter is code we wrote; its defects would be scored as the harness's.

**Countermeasure.** Smoke-test each adapter against a known-trivial task, and
assert that the adapter adds no behaviour the harness lacks -- no extra retries,
no output repair, no prompt massaging beyond the documented, identical scaffold
applied to every arm. Version-pin and record every adapter revision alongside
its results.

## T10 -- Selective reporting

Running many tasks and publishing the favourable subset.

**Countermeasure.** Freeze the task list and publish its hash before running.
Report every task, including infrastructure failures, which are classified
rather than dropped.

## T11 -- Host load is a confound for tasks with timing assertions

Some Terminal-Bench tasks assert *relative performance*, not just correctness.
`largest-eigenval`'s `test_speedup` is documented as "Make sure new
implementation is faster than reference" and compares isolated timings; five
tasks in the suite carry assertions of this kind (`cancel-async-tasks`,
`largest-eigenval`, `portfolio-optimization`, `query-optimize`, `tune-mjcf`).

Observed directly: running the oracle gate while a parallel image prefetch
saturated the disk and CPU produced

```
FAILED ../tests/test_outputs.py::test_speedup[8] - AssertionError: 0.000019 s
26 passed
```

-- 26 tests passing and exactly one timing assertion failing, on the reference
solution, which should score 100%. The task set was fine; the machine was busy.

**Why this is worse than ordinary flakiness.** It is not random. Load is
*correlated with arm and with run order*: whichever arm happens to run while
something else is happening on the host collects the failures. In an interleaved
schedule the damage is spread, but any concurrent work -- a prefetch, a build, a
second experiment -- biases towards whoever runs during it. A comparison run
alongside anything else is measuring the host, not the harness.

**Countermeasures.**

1. **Run the gate and the comparison on a quiet host.** This is the real fix.
   Nothing else heavy runs concurrently, and the prefetch completes first.
2. **Re-run timing-sensitive failures alone.** The five tasks above are
   identifiable by inspection, so a failure there under load is re-run rather
   than counted.
3. **Never let a load-induced failure enter a pass rate.** It belongs in
   `harness_error`, and `report.classify` already has that bucket -- but the
   detection here needs the test name, not just the reward, so it is currently a
   manual step and is listed as such in `docs/status.md`.

## T12 -- Measure one thing at a time: bulk transfers starve the verifiers

This is the most expensive mistake made while building this, and it produced a
completely wrong answer that looked like a real one.

**What happened.** The oracle gate was launched while task images were still
being pulled. Both paths share one proxy. The result, over 48 tasks:

```
9 passed / 39 failed  = 18.8%
```

with 35 of the 39 failures identical: `uvx: command not found`, meaning the
verifier never managed to download its own toolchain. The very same task set, run
with the machine otherwise idle, gave **12/13 = 92.3%** and climbing.

**The mechanism**, measured directly rather than reasoned about. With a single
8 GiB image layer in flight, from the two places that matter:

| Where | Download of the 21 MB uv binary |
| --- | --- |
| host, through the proxy | **180 KB in 60 s** (3 KB/s, then timeout) |
| inside a container, same proxy | 21 MB in 16 s (1.3 MB/s) |

and in the verifier logs, `curl: (35) OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in
connection to astral.sh:443`. Meanwhile `apt`, which is listed in the daemon's
`NO_PROXY` and therefore bypasses the proxy, kept working at 985 kB/s inside the
same containers. So the failure was specific to proxy-routed TLS under saturation,
not to the network as a whole.

**Why this is a trap rather than an obvious blunder.** Every individual piece
looked healthy. The proxy node answered its own latency probe in 61 ms. The
registry mirror responded. DNS resolved. `apt` succeeded. A single `curl` to
`astral.sh` returned `301`, which reads as success unless you follow the redirect
to the GitHub asset that actually carries the bytes. Nothing announces "you have
saturated the link" -- the symptom is that *another* subsystem's TLS handshakes
get reset, in containers, minutes later.

**Countermeasure, and it is mechanical rather than a matter of care.**
`scripts/quiet-gate.sh` refuses to start a gate while a `docker pull` is running
or while the proxy shows more than a handful of active connections. A rule that
depends on remembering is not a rule. This is the same discipline as T11 -- one
heavy thing at a time -- but the failure mode is worse: T11 corrupts a few timing
assertions, T12 corrupts the entire pass rate in a direction that looks like a
broken task set.

**How it was caught.** Only by the oracle baseline. A harness comparison run in
that state would have reported a plausible, publishable, entirely false result,
and no amount of statistical care downstream would have detected it. This is the
strongest argument in this repository for the oracle gate being load-bearing
rather than ceremonial.

## Resolution floor

From `report.tasks_required`: detecting a 5-point difference at 80% power needs
roughly 780 paired tasks. Terminal-Bench 2.0 provides on the order of 100. The
honest consequence is that this suite can only resolve **large** effects, and
"no significant difference" is the expected outcome for closely-matched
harnesses. Any write-up must state the resolution floor next to the result.
